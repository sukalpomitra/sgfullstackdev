Zookeeper NodeJS Leader Election Sample.

There may be a problem with the create function, 2nd create should be inside callback of first create or use promise / async / yield.

Or you can run first create (comment out the second) just to build the election root node, then comment out first create and then run.

You need to run zookeeper first, download official image from Docker and configure and run it (use kitematic is easiest)

Then run two instances (with a name you choose) after creating root election node

e.g.
node leader-election.js AAA
node leader-election.js BBB
